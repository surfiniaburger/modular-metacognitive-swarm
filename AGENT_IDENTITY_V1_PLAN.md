# Agent Identity V1 Plan (Modular Swarm)

Status: AUDITED (aligned with SafeClaw Blueprint)
Owner: Modular Swarm repo

## 1) Goal
Introduce a minimal, auditable identity layer for agents in the Modular Swarm. The design must:
- Provide per-agent identity (non-shared) with verifiable credentials
- Scope tool access by identity (manifest-based)
- Make identity visible in observability logs for traceability
- **Enforce "Discovery Blindness"**: Forbidden tools must be invisible to the agent during discovery.
- Remain compatible with Med Safety Gym primitives and SafeClaw Blueprint invariants

This is **V1**: short-lived delegation tokens + scoped manifests + hub logging. It does not include Teleport integration or full PKI automation (those are V2+).

## 2) Principles (from SafeClaw + Med Safety Gym)
- Trust the token, not the runner (Teleport RFD 0238 alignment)
- **Bidirectional filtering**: block disallowed tools AND strip them from discovery responses (`list_tools`).
- Least privilege by default: deny-all, allow by scoped manifest only
- Auditability: every action should be attributable to (user_id, agent_id, session_id)
- Short-lived credentials to reduce blast radius

## 3) Current State (Gap Analysis)
Already present in repo:
- Delegation token issuance/verification utilities (JWT HS256 or EdDSA):
  - `med_safety_gym/identity/scoped_identity.py`
- Secret storage (keyring):
  - `med_safety_gym/identity/secret_store.py`
- Agent handshake logic and manifest verification:
  - `med_safety_gym/claw_agent.py`
- Manifest interceptor (tool gating):
  - `med_safety_gym/manifest_interceptor.py`
- Observability hub (basic logging):
  - `hub/app.py`, `hub/chronicle.py`

Missing:
- Hub endpoints for `/auth/delegate`, `/manifest/pubkey`, `/manifest/scoped`
- Identity-aware logging (agent_id, profile, token_id)
- Central identity registry or session record

## 4) V1 Architecture

### 4.1 Components
- **Hub (Governor):** Issues tokens, signs manifests, stores session records
- **Agent Runner:** Requests delegation token + scoped manifest, caches them, verifies signature
- **Manifest Interceptor:** Enforces tool access at call-time and discovery-time
- **Observability Chronicle:** Logs identity metadata alongside events

### 4.2 Identity Entities
- **agent_id:** Stable per agent instance (UUIDv4)
- **session_id:** Per run or per iteration (already present in `claw_agent.py`)
- **profile:** “read_only”, “write”, “admin” (mapped to tool tiers)
- **token_id:** Unique JWT ID (jti)
- **delegator_id:** Optional user identity (if delegated by human)

### 4.3 Credential Format (V1)
- JWT (EdDSA / Ed25519)
- Claims:
  - `sub`: agent_id
  - `sid`: session_id
  - `profile`: profile name (e.g., `user`, `write`, `admin`)
  - `mid`: manifest_id (links the token to a specific tiered manifest)
  - `iat`, `exp`, `jti`

TTL recommendation:
- Default: 10–30 minutes
- Auto-renew on explicit handshake only

## 5) Hub API (V1)

### POST /auth/delegate
Request:
```json
{
  "session_id": "agent_session_abcdef",
  "profile": "read_only",
  "agent_id": "agent_123",
  "delegator_id": "optional_user_456"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "token": "<jwt>",
  "token_id": "<jti>",
  "expires_at": 1710000000
}
```

### GET /manifest/pubkey
Response:
```json
{ "pubkey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----..." }
```

### GET /manifest/scoped
Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
Response:
```json
{
  "manifest": { /* scoped manifest JSON */ },
  "signature": "<hex>"
}
```

### GET /identity/session/{session_id}
Returns a session record for audit/observability.

## 6) Scoped Manifest
- Hub produces scoped manifest by filtering global manifest using profile or explicit scope.
- Signature applied to canonical JSON so agents can verify integrity.

## 7) Logging & Observability (Hub)
Every log event should include:
- `agent_id`
- `session_id`
- `profile`
- `token_id`
- `event_type`
- `timestamp`

Example log payload:
```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_CALL",
  "agent_id": "agent_123",
  "session_id": "agent_session_abcdef",
  "profile": "read_only",
  "token_id": "jti_987",
  "tool": "read_file",
  "result": "allowed"
}
```

## 8) Agent Flow (V1)
1. Generate `agent_id` on boot (UUID)
2. Request delegation token from hub
3. Fetch hub pubkey
4. Fetch scoped manifest
5. Verify signature
6. Use manifest interceptor for every tool call + discovery
7. Log events with identity metadata

## 9) Security Invariants
- No tool call without a valid token
- Token must be fresh (exp not exceeded)
- Manifest must verify signature
- Interceptor blocks undeclared tools
- Discovery responses hide disallowed tools

## 10) Rollout Plan
Phase 0: Document + design review
Phase 1: Hub endpoints + session record
Phase 2: Agent identity injection + logging
Phase 3: Manifest signature verification enforced everywhere
Phase 4: External integration (Teleport or SPIFFE) (V2+)

## 11) Risks
- Token leakage: mitigate with short TTL and key rotation
- Identity collisions: enforce UUID uniqueness
- Hub single point: add fallback or local hub spawn only for dev

## 12) V2 Extensions (Out of scope)
- Teleport-based certs and delegation profiles
- SPIFFE-like identity binding
- Multi-agent memory isolation keyed by identity
- Cross-host identity federation

## 13) Resolved Design Decisions (Audit Findings)
- **Signing Key**: Use a **Dedicated Hub CA Key (Ed25519)**. Runners fetch the PEM public key at boot.
- **Scoping**: Scope tokens by **Manifest ID + Tier**. This prevents "Cross-Skill Escalation" and keeps JWTs lightweight.
- **Submission Signal**: Focus on proving **JIT Escalation** via HITL. Show that admin tools are invisible until the user approves the Telegram prompt.
